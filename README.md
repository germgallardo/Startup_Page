# Startup Landing Page

** Adaptation: Instead of a Startup page I built a webpage to showcase different travel locations **

[Coding challenge](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Coding_Challenge-8) from ZTM to build a startup landing page using Bootstrap 5 to showcase your product and with an email signup form.

Challenge Rules:
- Start from this [repository](https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-nuk)
- Use [NOW UI Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit) to build the project
- JS not allowed (only from Bootstrap templates) and neither CSS Grid
